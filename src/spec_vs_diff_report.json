  "summary": "REQ-10 and REQ-11 appear implemented: a dedicated predefined-labels module is added exporting exactly the 12 required labels, and AdminUploadForm is updated to include a dropdown listing these labels that auto-populates the English label field while keeping the Hindi label input present/editable (as far as can be seen in the truncated diff). No evidence of Hindi UI strings being introduced.",
